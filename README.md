### What I learned

` Hi everybody, welcome to my new solution :blush:

At first look this project seemed to be easy but positioning the background bubbles responsively turned out to become a real chalenge.

In this project I read some more in depth about background and learned alot, specially about background position.

I used grid for implementing the card part which was enjoyable and so helpful.
In the code below you can see the part I used for background positioning.

If you have any idea to improve my code or design it would be precious to me ,so please let me know`

```css
body {
  background: url(../images/bg-pattern-top.svg),
    url(../images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg), var(--sm-bg-color);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right 48vw bottom 40vh, left 45vw top 44vh;
}
```
